## Heat Equation Simulation on a cartesian plane with boundary conditions 




#### revisiting problem but in a transient state

- include college report here
- define problem being solved and improved solution ; with new tech stack and added features

#### heat Equation

- General Heat Transfer 
Q_in  + Q_gen - Q_out = 0

- Cartesian Heat Transfer Steady State
Txx + Tyy = 0

- Cartesian Transient Heat Transder
(Txx + Tyy)k/rho*c = Tt

k/rho*c = alpha (thermal diffusivity constant)
