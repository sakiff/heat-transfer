## Heat Equation Simulation on a cartesian plane with boundary conditions 

Here I am revisting the heat equation. I haven't done this since my college days so definitely was rusty and had to brush up on a bunch of material. Back then I ran simulations on MatLab, but here I'll be running them with some open source python libraries. 

- include college report here
- define problem being solved and improved solution ; with new tech stack and added features

#### heat Equation

- General Heat Transfer Equation in in 2D (Cartesian)
dU/dt - a(d2u/dx + d2u/dy) = 0

where tempature is represented by u, x and y being the spatial dimensions, t for time, and alpha is the thermal diffusivity constant.

the partial differential equation described the behavior of heat transfer infinitisemally over space and time. It would be impossible (or would take forever) for a computer to calculate an infinite number of heat transfer or temperature over an infinite number of time and space steps. 

we break this down by <i>discretizing</i> the solution into a finite number of time and space steps.



- Cartesian Heat Transfer Steady State
Txx + Tyy = 0

- Cartesian Transient Heat Transder
(Txx + Tyy)k/rho*c = Tt

k/rho*c = alpha (thermal diffusivity constant)
